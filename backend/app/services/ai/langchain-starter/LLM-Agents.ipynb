      "Summary: Tom Michael Mitchell (born August 9, 1951) is an American computer scientist and the Founders University Professor at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). He is a founder and former Chair of the Machine Learning Department at CMU. Mitchell is known for his contributions to the advancement of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and cognitive neuroscience and is the author of the textbook Machine Learning. He is a member of the United States National Academy of Engineering since 2010. He is also a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Association for the Advancement of Science and a Fellow and past President of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence. In October 2018, Mitchell was appointed as the Interim Dean of the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon.\n",

      "Page: Ensemble learning\n",
      "Summary: In statistics and machine learning, ensemble methods use multiple learning algorithms to obtain better predictive performance than could be obtained from any of the constituent learning algorithms alone.\n",
      "Unlike a statistical ensemble in statistical mechanics, which is usually infinite, a machine learning ensemble consists of only a concrete finite set of alternative models, but typically allows for much more flexible structure to exist among those alternatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Supervised learning algorithms perform the task of searching through a hypothesis space to find a suitable hypothesis that will make good predictions with a particular problem. Even if the hypothesis space contains hypotheses that are very well-suited for a particular problem, it may be very difficult to find a good one. Ensembles combine multiple hypotheses to form a (hopefully) better hypothesis.\n",
      "Ensemble learning trains two or more Machine Learning algorithms to a specific classification or regression task. The algorithms within the ensemble learning model are generally referred as \"base models\", \"base learners\" or \"weak learners\" in literature. The base models can be constructed using a single modelling algorithm or several different algorithms. The idea is train a diverse collection of weak performing models to the same modelling task. As a result, the predicted or classified outcomes of each weak learner have poor predictive ability (high bias, i.e. high model errors) and among the collection of all weak learners the outcome and error values exhibit high variance. Fundamentally, an ensemble learning model trains many (at least 2) high-bias (weak) and high-variance (diverse) models to be combined into a stronger and better performing model. Essentially, it's a set of algorithmic models — which would not produce satisfactory predictive results individually — that gets combined or averaged over all base models to produce a single high performing, accurate and low-variance model to fit the task as required.\n",
      "Ensemble learning typically refers to Bagging (bootstrap-aggregating), Boosting or Stacking/Blending techniques to induce high variability among the base models. Bagging creates diversity by generating random samples from the training observations and fitting the same model to each different sample — also known as \"homogeneous parallel ensembles\". Boosting follows an iterative process by sequentially training each next base model on the up-weighted errors of the previous base model's errors, producing an additive model to reduce the final model errors — also known as \"sequential ensemble learning\". Stacking or Blending consists of different base models, each trained independently (i.e. diverse/high variability) to be combined into the ensemble model — producing a \"heterogeneous parallel ensemble\". Common applications of ensemble learning include Random Forests (extension of Baggin), Boosted Tree-Models, Gradient Boosted Tree-Models and models in applications of stacking are generally more task-specific — such as combing clustering techniques with other parametric and/or non-parametric tech\u001b[0m\n",
