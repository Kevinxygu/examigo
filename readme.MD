Examigo generates practice problems from class notes.

## :book: Learnings

This was the most technically complex project I built, but in my eyes also the most impactful for a.) those around me and b.) my learning and experiences as an engineer, product manager, and generally someone interested in using tech to help people. I REALLY wanted to dive into the deep end here. Get uncomfortable. Learn a BUNCH of new things. You'll notice the list of learnings I have below is REALLY long, so I split it up into two parts: Technical Learnings and Soft Skill Learnings.
