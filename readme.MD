Examigo generates practice problems from class notes.

## :book: Learnings

This was the most technically complex project I built, but in my eyes also the most impactful for a.) those around me and b.) my learning and experiences as an engineer. I REALLY wanted to dive into the deep end here. Get uncomfortable. Learn a BUNCH of new things. You'll notice the list of learnings I have below is REALLY long, and I'm proud of that.

The list is really long, so I split it up into two parts. Technical Learnings and Soft Skill Learnings

## :laptop: Technical Learnings

| Concept | Learnings |
|:---|:---|
| LangChain | Will write soon, but TLDR very cool. helped me learn more about AI.|
| Prompt Engineering | Will write soon, TLDR also very cool and I learned a lot from really cracked AI + ML engineers and researchers.|
| Flask | Will write soon, TLDR i liked using it. |
| Databases | Will write soon, TLDR first time i went and implemented the schema on my own.|
| APIs | Will write soon, TLDR I solidified core concepts like endpoints, requests, etc. |
| Healthy Coding Practices | Will write soon, TLDR I coded cleaner and safer. |
| Effective AI Usage | Will write soon, TLDR I learned how to use Claude and ChatGPT well. |
| TypeScript | Will write soon, TLDR I started using more features of TS after learning the fundamentals.|
| Python | Will write soon, TLDR I learned how to use Python as part of a multi-language codebase.|

## :coffee: Soft Skill Learnings

| Concept | Learnings |
|:---|:---|
| User Interviews | Will write soon, TLDR I did a LOT of user interviews and had to re-adjust my questions and conversations several times. |
| Consider Legal | Will write soon, TLDR I talked with teachers to get the green light on the project and consider any pitfalls I could fall into inadvertently around university copyrighting, regulations. |
| Challenging Assumptions | Will write soon, TLDR I went back to Square One several times to re-consider: a.) Is this what users want? b.) Am I prescribing this as "the solution" based on my individual bias? c.) How is this reflected in what users are saying? Overall, I wanted to practice defining the "product" vision, evaluating how it lines up with what users are saying, and pivoting if needed. |
| Design and Figma | Will write soon, TLDR I learned to take inspirations from good UIs that matched up with my use case. I took inspiration from sites like Quizlet, Khan Academy, Brilliant.org|

## :city_sunrise: Future Features + Considerations
[Aug 15] - A LOT OF THEM ARE COMING SOON!!! Will write about it later :)
